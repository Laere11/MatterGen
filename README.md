  <h1>What is MatterGen?</h1>
  <p>
    MatterGen is a generative diffusion model designed for inorganic materials design. It creates novel crystal structures by jointly predicting atomic coordinates, elements, and unit cell lattice vectors. In addition to unconditional generation, MatterGen supports property-conditioned generation (e.g., targeting specific bulk modulus, magnetic density, or chemical systems) and fine-tuning on custom property data. It aims to accelerate the discovery of new materials by directly generating candidates with desired properties rather than screening existing databases.

  <h2>Key problems MatterGen can solve:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Novel Materials Discovery:</strong> Generate new, unique, and stable crystal structures.</li>
    <li><strong>Property-Guided Design:</strong> Directly produce materials that meet user-defined property criteria.</li>
    <li><strong>Overcoming Database Limitations:</strong> Explore regions of materials space not covered by existing datasets.</li>
    <li><strong>Accelerated Screening:</strong> Improve efficiency over traditional high-throughput screening by reducing computational overhead.</li>
  </ul>
