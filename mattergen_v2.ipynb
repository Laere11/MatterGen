        "# **How Are the Crystal Structures Generated?**\n",
        "\n",
        "MatterGen is not simply copying structures from a database—instead, it generates new crystal structures using a diffusion model. Here’s a more detailed breakdown of how the 15 crystal structures are created:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Training on Real Data:**\n",
        "MatterGen was trained on a large dataset (over 600,000 stable materials) from sources like the Materials Project and Alexandria. This training teaches the model the underlying chemical rules and structural patterns that make a crystal stable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Diffusion-Based Generation:**\n",
        "When you run the model (in unconditional mode in this case), it starts with a random initial structure (essentially random noise) and then gradually “denoises” that structure over many iterations. In each iteration, the model updates atomic positions, element assignments, and lattice parameters in a way that is informed by the patterns it learned during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Batch Sampling:**\n",
        "The 15 structures you mention are the result of generating a batch of candidates. The number of outputs is determined by the product of your specified batch size and number of batches. Each output is the end result of the iterative diffusion process—a structure that the model “imagined” based on its training.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Novel and Chemically Plausible:**\n",
        "The structures generated are novel candidate materials. They are not randomly assembled nor merely pulled from a repository; instead, they are produced by the model’s learned distribution over crystal structures. Some generated structures may resemble known prototypes, but they are synthesized “on the fly” by the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the 15 crystal structures are generated by MatterGen’s diffusion process, which leverages learned knowledge from real, stable materials. They’re not randomly assembled nor directly copied from any database—they’re new candidates produced by the generative AI model."

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
